📈 Gold Price Forecasting Using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting gold prices using machine learning techniques based on historical market data. It analyzes past gold price trends and builds predictive models to estimate future prices.
The project covers the complete data science pipeline including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model building, evaluation, and deployment through a simple web application.
This system helps in understanding gold market behavior and can support financial forecasting and investment analysis.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical gold price data
Perform data preprocessing and visualization
Build and compare machine learning models
Predict future gold prices
Deploy the trained model using a web application

🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains historical gold price records with features such as:
